If you can keep your head whn all about you
Are losin theirs and blaming it on you ;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you ,
But make allowance for their doubting too ;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting ,
Or , being lied about , don't deal in lis ,
Or , being hated , don't give way to hating ,
And yet don't look too good , nor talk too wise ;
